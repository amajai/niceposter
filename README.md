#### Using Niceposter

To start creating an image poster, you have to initialize it, like so: 
```python
from niceposter import Create

bg_image = Create.Poster() # default size of 500x500
```

Then use any one of the methods to make or add changes to an image. Examples:
```python
bg_image.add_image('cool-image.png', position='cc', scale=20) # added in center of the bg image and scaled down by 20%
bg_image.text('Interesting text!', position(50,50), color='red', align='center')
bg_image.frame(thickness=10)
bg_image.filter(rgb=(255,255,255), opacity=50)
```
